# LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-06
# Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

This repository contains code and resources for making predictions using the Decision Tree algorithm. The Decision Tree is a versatile and interpretable machine learning model that can be used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project should be prepared according to the type of prediction you are interested in (classification or regression). It should include features (input variables) and the corresponding target variable (for supervised learning). You can use publicly available datasets or create your own.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-06
```

2. Obtain or prepare the dataset you want to work with and save it as a CSV file in the `data` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository (`decision_tree_prediction.ipynb`) to see the step-by-step process of loading the data, preprocessing it, training a Decision Tree model, and making predictions.

4. Alternatively, you can run the provided Python script (`decision_tree_prediction.py`) using the command:

```bash
python decision_tree_prediction.py
```

## Results

The notebook and script will demonstrate how to train a Decision Tree model on your dataset and use it to make predictions. For classification tasks, you'll see how to assess accuracy and visualize the decision boundaries. For regression tasks, you'll observe how the model fits the data and makes predictions.
